    \list 1

        \li Select \uicontrol File > \uicontrol {New Project} >
            \uicontrol {Application (Qt)} > \uicontrol {Qt Quick Application}.

        \li Select \uicontrol Next (or \uicontrol Continue on \macos) to open
            the \uicontrol {Define Build System} dialog.

        \li In the \uicontrol {Build system} field, select \l {Setting Up CMake}
            {CMake} as the build system to use for building and running the
            project.

            \note If you select \l qmake, the instructions for configuring the

        \li Select Qt 6.2 or later \l{glossary-buildandrun-kit}{kits} for the
            platforms that you want to build the application for. To build
            applications for mobile devices, select kits also for Android and
            iOS.

            \note Kits are listed if they have been specified in \uicontrol Edit
            > \uicontrol Preferences > \uicontrol Kits (on Windows and Linux)
            or in \uicontrol {\QC} > \uicontrol Preferences >
            \uicontrol Kits (on \macos).
            For more information, see \l {Adding Kits}.

        \li Select \uicontrol Next to open the \uicontrol {Project Management}
            dialog.
