    \title Validating with Target Hardware

    You can use the live preview feature to preview a UI file or the entire
    UI on the desktop, as well as on embedded Linux
    devices. The changes you make to the UI are instantly visible
    to you in the preview. While the preview is available on Android devices,
    it does not instantly reflect the changes made to the UI in the editor. It
    shows the snapshot of your project from the moment you start the preview on
    the device.

    In addition, you can use \QDV to run
    \if defined(qtcreator)
    \l{Creating Qt Quick UI Projects}{Qt Quick UI projects}
    \else
    applications
    \endif
    in most widely-used web browsers on the desktop and in mobile devices This
    enables you to easily share your designs with reviewers who don't have \QC.

            \l {Connecting Devices}.
            \else
            When you install \QDS, everything you need for previewing on
            devices is set up automatically. You only need to connect your
            devices to your system.
