    \title Inspecting Internal Logs

    You can inspect internal log messages of \QC at runtime without having to
    restart it or configure the logging rules. Log messages are helpful when
    you develop \QC, need to investigate some problem you are facing, or want
    to take a look behind the scenes.

    To open the log viewer and start collecting log information, select
    \uicontrol Tools > \uicontrol {Debug \QC} > \uicontrol {Show Logs}.

    \image qtcreator-logging-category-viewer.png

    The viewer displays log messages from the selected logging categories.
    If you have logging rules defined, they might be listed on startup.
    Otherwise, the list of categories is extended while you are using \QC.

    \note Messages are not cached, so the viewer displays only messages that
    are recorded after you enabled a category.

    \section1 Viewing Logs

    To enable logging categories, select them in \uicontrol Category.
    \uicontrol Type specifies the minimum level of messages to display from
    the respective category. To change the minimum level, double-click the
    type and select another value.

    If you enable more than one category, you can specify different colors for
    the messages in each category. Double-click the value of \uicontrol Color to
    pick colors for the categories.

    To store information about the currently enabled categories, select
    \uicontrol {Save Enabled as Preset} in the context-menu. To load the
    saved information, select \uicontrol {Update from Preset}.

    To save the content of the displayed messages, select
    \inlineimage icons/savefile.png
    (\uicontrol {Save Log}). To copy all or selected messages, select
    \uicontrol {Copy All} or \uicontrol {Copy Selected Logs} in the
    context menu.

    To clean the content of displayed messages select
    \inlineimage icons/clean_pane_small.png
    (\uicontrol Clear).

    To temporarily stop logging, select \inlineimage icons/stop_small.png
    (\uicontrol {Stop Logging}). To continue logging, select
    \inlineimage icons/run_small.png
    (\uicontrol {Start Logging}).

    By default, logging categories and messages coming directly from Qt are
    disabled. To display them, select \inlineimage icons/qtlogo-16.png
    (\uicontrol {Toggle Qt Internal Logging}).

    New messages automatically scroll the message display to the bottom.
    To stop automatic scrolling, toggle \inlineimage icons/arrowdown.png
    (\uicontrol {Auto Scroll}).

    By default, messages are listed with a timestamp, without message
    type. To hide and show this information, toggle
    \inlineimage icons/stopwatch.png
    (\uicontrol Timestamps) and \inlineimage icons/message.png
    (\uicontrol {Message Types}).
