    \title Deploying Applications to Generic Remote Linux Devices

    You can specify settings for deploying applications to generic remote
    Linux devices in the project configuration file and in the
    \uicontrol Projects mode, in \uicontrol {Run Settings}.

    \image qtcreator-embedded-linux-deployment-details.png "Deploy to embedded Linux"

    The files to be installed are listed in the \uicontrol {Deployment} step,
    the \uicontrol {Files to deploy} field. The \uicontrol {Source File Path}
    field displays the location of the file on the development PC. The
    \uicontrol {Target Directory} field displays the directory where the file is
    installed on the device. Text in red color indicates that the information is
    missing.

    If the build system did not automatically detect the source and target
    directories, select \uicontrol {Override deployment data from build system},
    and then select \uicontrol Add to enter them manually. To remove the
    selected paths from \uicontrol {Files to deploy}, select \uicontrol Remove.

    \section1 Adding Missing Files

    The process to add files to deploy depends on the build system you use.
    For more information, see \l{Specifying Project Contents}.

    \section2 CMake Builds

    When using CMake as the build system, use the \l{CMake: install command}
    {install} command in the CMakeLists.txt file to add the missing files.

    For example, add the following lines to the CMakeLists.txt file to install
    the binary of your project to the \c /opt directory on the remote device:

    \badcode
    set(INSTALL_DESTDIR "/opt")

    install(TARGETS <target>
        RUNTIME DESTINATION "${INSTALL_DESTDIR}"
        BUNDLE DESTINATION "${INSTALL_DESTDIR}"
        LIBRARY DESTINATION "${INSTALL_DESTDIR}"
    )
    \endcode

    \section2 qmake Builds

    When using qmake, edit the \l{Variables#installs}{INSTALLS variable} in
    the project \c .pro file.

    When you run the application, \QC copies the necessary files to the device
    and starts the application on it.

    For example, add the following lines to the \c .pro file to copy the binary
    of your project to the \c /opt directory on the remote device:

    \code
      target.path = /opt
      INSTALLS += target
    \endcode

    To deploy additional files, add them to further targets that you also add
    to \c INSTALLS.

    \section1 Deploy Steps

    When you run the application on the device, \QC first uploads the
    necessary files to it, as specified by the deploy steps.

    \section2 Uploading Files

    By default, \QC copies the application files to the device by
    using the SSH file transfer protocol (SFTP), as specified by
    the \uicontrol {Upload files via SFTP} step.

    \note If the SFTP upload fails, make sure that the remote device has SFTP
    enabled in its SSH daemon. Some versions of Dropbear that come without SFTP
    support will crash when an SFTP upload is being attempted. This is not a bug
    in \QC.

    If you have a lot of data to copy, select \uicontrol Details in the
    \uicontrol {Upload Files via SFTP} step, and then select the
    \uicontrol {Incremental deployment} check box. \QC takes note of the
    deployment time and only copies files that have changed since the last
    deployment. However, when you make major changes on the device, such as
    removing files from the device manually or flashing a new disk image, or
    when you use another device with the same IP address, deselect the check box
    once, to have \QC deploy all files again.

    \section2 Creating a Tarball

    To only create a tarball and not copy the files to the device, select
    \uicontrol {Add Deploy Step} > \uicontrol {Create tarball}. Then remove all
    other deploy steps.

    The \uicontrol {Deploy tarball via SFTP upload} step specifies that \QC
    uploads the tarball to the device and extracts it.
