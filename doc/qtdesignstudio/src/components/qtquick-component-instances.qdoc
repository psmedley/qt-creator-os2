    \title Creating Component Instances

    \QDS comes with \e {preset components} that you can use in your UI by
    creating instances of them.

    \image qmldesigner-editing-components.png "Creating Component Instances"

    To create component instances and edit their properties:

    \list 1
        \li Drag-and-drop components from \uicontrol Components (1) to
            \l Navigator (2), \l {Form Editor} (3), or \l {3D Editor} (4).
            This creates instances of the components in the current
            component file.
        \li Select component instances in \uicontrol Navigator to edit the
            values of their properties in \uicontrol Properties.
            \image qmldesigner-properties-view.png "Properties view"
            For more information, see \l {Specifying Component Properties}.
        \li To change the appearance and behavior of the component instances
            in ways that are not supported in \QDS by default, you can define
            custom properties in \l {Connection View} > \uicontrol {Properties}.
            \image qmldesigner-dynamicprops.png "Connection View Properties tab"
            For more information, see \l{Specifying Dynamic Properties}.
        \li To enable users to interact with the component instances, connect
            the instances to signals in \uicontrol {Connection View} >
            \uicontrol Connections. For example, you can specify what happens
            when a component instance is clicked. For more information, see
            \l{Connecting Components to Signals}.
            \image qmldesigner-connections.png "Connection View Connections tab"
        \li To dynamically change the behavior of a component instance when
            another component instance changes, create bindings between them in
            \uicontrol {Connection View} > \uicontrol Bindings.
            For more information, see \l{Adding Bindings Between Properties}.
            \image qmldesigner-bindings.png "Connection View Bindings tab"
        \li Add states to apply sets of changes to the property values of one
            or several component instances in the \uicontrol States view.
            For more information, see \l{Adding States}.
        \li Animate the properties of component instances in the
            \uicontrol Timeline view. For more information, see
            \l{Creating Timeline Animations}.
