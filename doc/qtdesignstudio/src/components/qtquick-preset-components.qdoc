    \title Preset Components

    To use preset components, add the modules that contain them to your project
    by selecting \uicontrol Components > \inlineimage icons/plus.png
    . For more information, see \l{Adding and Removing Modules}. You can then
    create instances of the components by dragging-and-dropping them from
    \uicontrol Components to \l {Form Editor}, \l {3D Editor}, or \l Navigator.

    To edit the appearance of a component instance, select it in
    \uicontrol {Form Editor}, \uicontrol {3D Editor}, or \uicontrol Navigator
    and set its properties in the \l Properties view.

    For more information about creating your own components, see
    \l{Creating Custom Components}.

    \section1 3D Components

    You can use \l{3D Editor} in the \uicontrol Design mode to edit files you
    created using 3D graphics applications and stored in one of the supported
    formats. You cannot create 3D models or other assets in the editor, but you
    can \l{Importing 3D Assets}{import} the assets you need and work with them
    to create scenes and states, as well as the transitions between them.

        \list
        \li \l {3D Views}
        \li \l {Node}
        \li \l {Group}
        \li \l {Instanced Rendering}
        \li \l {Skeletal Animation}
        \li \l {3D Models}
        \li \l {Materials and Shaders}
        \li \l {Textures}
        \li \l {3D Materials}
        \li \l {3D Effects}
        \li \l {Custom Shaders}
        \li \l {Custom Effects and Materials}
        \li \l {Lights}
        \li \l {Cameras}
        \li \l {Scene Environment}
        \li \l {Morph Target}
        \li \l {Repeater3D}
        \li \l {Loader3D}
        \li \l {Particles}
     \endlist

    When you import 3D scenes from files that you exported from 3D graphics
    tools, you also import the camera, light, model, and materials as 3D
    components. If your scene did not contain them, you can add predefined
    3D components to it and edit their properties to fit your needs.

    \note Using 3D components will affect the performance of your UI. Do not
    use 3D components if the same results can be achieved using 2D components.

    \section2 Videos About 3D Components

    The following video shows you how to add the components included in the
    \uicontrol {Qt Quick 3D} module, such as 3D models, cameras, and lights,
    to your scene:

    The following video shows you how to use the custom shader utilities, 3D
    effects, and materials:
