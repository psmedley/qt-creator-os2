    \title 3D Editor

    When editing a 3D scene, you view the scene in the \uicontrol {3D Editor}
    view. You can change the projection of the view by switching between
    \e {perspective camera} and \e {orthographic camera} modes. When using the
    perspective camera mode, components that are far from the camera appear
    smaller than those nearby. In the orthographic camera mode, all components
    appear at the same scale irrespective of their distance from the camera.
    Both of them are free-form camera modes that you can use to orbit around
    the scene.

    When you import 3D scenes from files that you exported from 3D graphics
    tools, you also import a \l{Cameras}{scene camera},
    \l{Lights}{light}, \l{3D Models}{model}, and
    \l {Materials and Shaders}{materials}. If your scene did not contain
    them, you can add the corresponding \l {3D Components}{Qt Quick 3D}
    components from \uicontrol Components > \inlineimage icons/plus.png
    > \uicontrol {Qt Quick 3D} > \uicontrol {Qt Quick 3D}.

    You can use the \l{Summary of the 3D Editor Toolbar Buttons}{toolbar buttons}
    to \e transform 3D components and manipulate the 3D scene. Transformation
    refers to moving, rotating, or scaling of a component. The \e pivot of the
    component is used as the origin for transformations. You can set a
    \l{Managing 3D Transformations}{local pivot offset} for a component in
    \uicontrol Properties to transform the component around a point other than
    its local origin. A line is drawn in \uicontrol {3D Editor} from the pivot
    point to the center of the component to provide a visual connection between
    them. Especially when working with complex scenes, it may be useful to use
    the \l {Showing and Hiding Components}{showing and hiding} or the
    \l {Locking Components}{locking} features in \l Navigator to avoid
    transforming components by mistake while editing your scene.

    Toggle between local and global orientation to determine whether the gizmos
    affect only the local transformations of the component or whether they
    transform with respect to the global space.

    Another helpful feature when editing 3D scenes is the \e {edit light},
    which is a quick way to light the scene.

    Additionally, you can toggle the visibility of the grid, selection boxes,
    icon gizmos, and camera frustums in the 3D scene.

    To refresh the contents of \uicontrol {3D Editor}, press \key P or
    select the \inlineimage icons/reset.png
    (\uicontrol {Reset View}) button.

    \section1 Controlling the 3D Editor Camera

    To switch to perspective camera mode, select
    \inlineimage perspective_camera.png
    (\uicontrol {Toggle Perspective/Orthographic Edit Camera}).
    To switch to orthographic camera mode, select
    \inlineimage orthographic_camera.png
    . You can also Toggle the camera mode by using the keyboard shortcut \key T.

    You can navigate the scene by panning, rotating, and zooming the 3D Editor
    camera:

    \list
        \li To pan, press \key Alt (or \key Option on \macos) and use the
            middle mouse button to click and drag anywhere in the rendered
            view to slide the view around.
            \note It is not possible to pan using Magic Mouse.
        \li To orbit, press \key Alt and click and drag anywhere in the rendered
            view to rotate the view.
        \li To zoom, use the mouse wheel or press \key Alt and right-click
            anywhere in the rendered view to zoom the view in or out as you drag
            up or down.
    \endlist

    To zoom and focus the 3D Editor camera on a selected component,
    select \inlineimage fit_selected.png
    (\uicontrol {Fit Selected}) or press \key F.

    The world axis helper (1) shows the direction of the world axes in the view.
    To point the camera at the currently selected component in the direction of
    an axis, click the axis. Clicking the dot at the end of the axis will point
    the camera at the opposite direction of the axis. If no component is
    selected, the camera is pointed at the world origin. This does not affect
    the camera zoom level.

    \image studio-3d-editor-axis-helper.png "Axis helper in 3D Editor"

    You can use scene cameras (2) to view the \uicontrol View3D component from a
    specific angle in \l {Form Editor} while editing scenes. Different types of
    cameras are available in \uicontrol Components
    > \uicontrol {Qt Quick 3D} > \uicontrol {Qt Quick 3D}. For more information
    about using cameras in the scene, the available camera types, and their
    properties, see \l{Cameras}.

    \section1 Using Global and Local Orientation

    To switch between local and global orientation, select
    \inlineimage local.png
    or \inlineimage global.png
    (\uicontrol {Toggle Local/Global Orientation})
    or press \key Y.

    In global orientation mode, transformation of a selected component is
    presented with respect to the global space. For example, while the move tool
    is selected, selecting a cube will show its move gizmo aligned with the axes
    of global space. Dragging on the red arrow of the gizmo moves the component
    in the global x direction.

    In local orientation mode, the position of a selected component is shown
    according to local axes specific to the selected component. For example,
    selecting a rotated cube will show its axes rotated, and not aligned with
    the axes of global space. Dragging on the red arrow of the gizmo moves the
    component in the local x direction in relation to the component.

    \section1 Using Edit Light

    The edit light is an extra point light that can be used to illuminate the
    scene. To toggle the edit light on and off, select \inlineimage edit_light_on.png
    or \inlineimage edit_light_off.png
    (\uicontrol {Toggle Edit Light})
    or press \key U.

    For more information about the available scene light types and their
    properties, see \l{Lights}.

    \section1 Selecting Components

    To move, rotate, or scale components in the scene, you need to select them
    first. The selection mode buttons determine how components are selected when
    you click them in \uicontrol {3D Editor}:

    \list
        \li In the \inlineimage select_item.png
            (\uicontrol {Single Selection}) mode, a single component is selected.
        \li In the \inlineimage select_group.png
            (\uicontrol {Group Selection}) mode, the top level parent of the
            component is selected. This enables you to move, rotate, or scale a
            group of components.
    \endlist

    To toggle the selection mode, press \key Q.

    To multiselect, hold \key Ctrl and click the components you wish to select.

    After selecting a component, you can apply the usual \l {Keyboard Shortcuts}
    {keyboard shortcuts} applicable to your operating system, for example,
    \key Ctrl+C and \key Ctrl+V on Windows to copy-paste components.

    \target moving components 3d editor
    \section1 Moving Components

    \image studio-3d-editor-move.png "3D Editor in move mode"

    You can move components in relation to their coordinate system, along the x,
    y, or z axis or on the top, bottom, left, and right clip planes of the
    \uicontrol {3D Editor} view.

    To move components, select \inlineimage move_on.png
    or press \key W:

    \list
        \li To move components along the axes of the move gizmo, click the axis,
            and drag the component along the axis.
        \li To move components on a plane, click the plane handle and drag the
            component on the plane.
        \li To move an component freely in 3D editor, click and drag the gray
            handle at the center of the move gizmo.
     \endlist

    \section1 Rotating Components

    \image studio-3d-editor-rotate.png "3D Editor in rotate mode"

    To rotate components, select \inlineimage rotate_on.png
    or press \key E:

    \list
        \li To rotate a component around its rotation gizmo, click the axis ring
            and drag in the direction you want to rotate the component in.
        \li To freely rotate the component, click and drag the inner center
            circle of the gizmo.
    \endlist

    \section1 Scaling Components

    \image studio-3d-editor-scale.png "3D Editor in scale mode"

    You can use the scale handles to adjust the local x, y, or z scale of a
    component. You can adjust the scale across one, two, or three axes,
    depending on the handle.

    To scale components, select \inlineimage scale_on.png
    or press \key R:

    \list
        \li To adjust the scale across one axis, click and drag the scale handle
            attached to the axis.
        \li To adjust the scale across a plane, click the plane handle and drag
            the component on the plane.
        \li To uniformly scale a component across all axes, click and drag the
            gray handle at the center of the component.
    \endlist

    \section1 Aligning Views and Cameras

    To align a camera to the \uicontrol {3D Editor} view:
    \list 1
      \li Select a camera in \uicontrol {3D Editor} or \uicontrol {Navigator}.
      \li In \uicontrol {3D Editor},
      select \inlineimage icons/align-camera-on.png
      .
    \endlist

    This moves and rotates the camera so that the camera shows the same view
    as the current view in \uicontrol {3D Editor}.

    To align the \uicontrol {3D Editor} view to a camera:
        \list 1
      \li Select a camera in \uicontrol {3D Editor} or \uicontrol {Navigator}.
      \li In \uicontrol {3D Editor},
      select \inlineimage icons/align-view-on.png
      .
    \endlist

    This copies the position as well as x and y rotation values from the
    camera and applies them to \uicontrol {3D Editor}.

    \section1 Toggling Visibility

    To toggle the visibility of objects in \uicontrol {3D Editor}, select
    \inlineimage icons/visibilityon.png
    in the toolbar. This opens a menu with the following options:

    \table
      \row
        \li Show Grid
        \li Toggles the visibility of the helper grid.
      \row
        \li Show Selection Boxes
        \li Toggles the visibility of selection boxes for selected 3D objects.
      \row
        \li Show Icon Gizmos
        \li Toggles the visibility of icon gizmos for object such as cameras,
            lights, and particle systems.
      \row
        \li Always Show Camera Frustums
        \li Toggles between always showing the camera frustum and showing it
        only for cameras selected in \uicontrol {3D Editor}.
      \row
        \li Always Show Particle Emitters and Attractors
        \li Toggle between always showing the particle emitter and attractor
        visualizations and only showing them when the emitter or attractor is
        selected in \uicontrol {3D Editor}.
    \endtable

    \section1 Particle Editor

    The particle editor tools help you preview your particle systems in
    \uicontrol {3D Editor}. You can select one particle system to preview at a
    time.

    To preview a particle system in \uicontrol{3D Editor}:

    \list 1
      \li Select a particle system in \uicontrol Navigator or
      \uicontrol {3D Editor}.
      \li In the \uicontrol {3D Editor}, select
      \inlineimage icons/particle-animation-on.png
      to activate particle animation. Now you can see the particle animation in
      \uicontrol{3D Editor}.
    \endlist

    You can pause the particle animation by selecting
    \inlineimage icons/particle-animation-on.png
    . When the animation is paused, you can use
    \inlineimage icons/particles-seek.png
    to manually seek forward or backward in the particle animation.
