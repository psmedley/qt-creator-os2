    \title Exporting from Design Tools

    When working with 2D assets, you can use \QB to export them from design
    tools into a metadata format that you can then \l{Importing Designs}{import}
    into \QDS.

    When working with 3D assets, you can use the export functions provided by
    the 3D graphics tools to save the assets in widely-used 3D graphics formats,
    and then use \QB to import them into \QDS.

    For best results when importing assets, follow
    the guidelines for creating and exporting them.

    \section1 2D Assets

    You can use the Qt Installer to install \QB if you have a commercial
    \QDS license. You can also purchase a \QB license separately from the
    \l{https://marketplace.qt.io/}{Qt Marketplace} and then install \QB using
    the Qt Installer.

    You can import files you created using 3D graphics applications and
    stored in several widely-used formats, such as .blend, .dae, .fbx,
    .glb, .gltf, .obj, .uia, or .uip.
