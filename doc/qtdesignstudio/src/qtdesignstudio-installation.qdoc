    \title Installation

    You can install \QDS either using a stand-alone installation package or the
    Qt online installer. The installers copy all the modules and tools you need
    to design UIs and preview them on the desktop to your computer and configure
    them for you. \QDS is available for Linux, \macOS, and Windows operating
    systems. For more information, see \l{Supported Platforms}.

    To begin, create a \l{Qt Account}. This account gives you access to a web
    portal to manage your licenses and download the standalone \QDS package or
    the Qt online installer. Alternatively, you can download an evaluation
    package \l{https://www.qt.io/product/ui-design-tools}{here}.

    After the installation, you can start exploring \QDS by following
    \l{Tutorials}{tutorials}, opening
    \l{Examples}{examples}, watching videos, and reading
    this manual.
