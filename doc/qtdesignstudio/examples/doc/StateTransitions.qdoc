    \title Animated State Transitions
    \brief Illustrates how to create animated state transitions.

    \image animated-state-transitions.jpg

    The \e{Animated State Transitions} tutorial illustrates how you can animate
    the transition between \l{Adding States}{states}.

    The starting point of this tutorial is the Car Demo project, you can
    download it from
    \l{https://git.qt.io/public-demos/qtdesign-studio/-/tree/master/tutorial%20projects/animated-state-transition/Start/CarDemo}
    {here}.

    You can download the completed project from
    \l{https://git.qt.io/public-demos/qtdesign-studio/-/tree/master/tutorial%20projects/animated-state-transition/Completed/CarDemo}
    {here}.

    This tutorial requires that you know the basics of \QDS, see
    \l{Getting Started}.

    \section1 Tutorial Assets

    All assets you need for this tutorial are included in the Car Demo project.

    \section1 Creating States

    First, you create the different states. In this tutorial, you create four
    different states with different views of the car in the scene:
    \list
      \li Side view
      \li Front view
      \li Back view
      \li Interior view
    \endlist

    To create the first state:
    \list 1
      \li In the \l States view, select \inlineimage icons/plus.png
      .
      \li Change the name of the new state to \e{side}.
    \endlist

    For the \e side state, you do not need to make any changes to the car model
    because it is already in side view position.

    Next, create the rest of the states and change the rotation of the car. For
    the \e interior state, you also change the position of the camera:
    \list 1
      \li Create a new state and change the name to \e{front}.
      \li In \l{Navigator}, select \e car_final and in
      \l{Properties}, set \uicontrol Transform > \uicontrol Rotation >
      \uicontrol Y to 0.
      \li Create a new state and change the name to \e{back}.
      \li In \uicontrol{Navigator}, select \e car_final and in
      \uicontrol{Properties}, set \uicontrol Transform > \uicontrol Rotation >
      \uicontrol Y to 180.
      \li Create a new state and change the name to \e{interior}.
      \li In \uicontrol{Navigator}, select \e camera1 and in
      \uicontrol{Properties}, set \uicontrol Transform > \uicontrol Translation
      > \uicontrol Z to 20.
    \endlist

    \section1 Creating State Transitions

    With the states created, you need a way to move between the states in the
    UI. In this tutorial, you create buttons arranged in a column to do this.

    \note Ensure that you have the base state selected before you add the
    buttons.

    To add the buttons:

    \list 1
      \li From \l{Components}, drag \uicontrol Column to \e rectangle in
      \uicontrol{Navigator}.
      \li In \uicontrol{Navigator}, select \e column and in
      \uicontrol{Properties}, set:
      \list
        \li \uicontrol Size > \uicontrol H to 200.
        \li \uicontrol Spacing to 10.
      \endlist
      \li In \uicontrol{Properties}, go to the \uicontrol Layout tab.
      \li Select \uicontrol Anchors > \uicontrol{Bottom} and set:
      \list
        \li \uicontrol Target to parent.
        \li \uicontrol Margin to 10.
      \endlist
      \li Select \uicontrol Anchors > \uicontrol{Left} and set:
      \list
        \li \uicontrol Target to parent.
        \li \uicontrol Margin to 10.
      \endlist
      \li From \uicontrol {Components}, drag \uicontrol Button to \e column in
      \uicontrol {Navigator}.
      \li In \uicontrol {Navigator}, select \e button and set \uicontrol ID to
      \e {button_side}.
      \li On the \uicontrol Button tab, set \uicontrol Text to \e {Side}.
      \li Repeat step 6 to 8 three times to create a total of four buttons. Set
      the ID for the three last buttons to \e{button_front}, \e{button_back},
      and \e {button_interior}. Change the text on the buttons accordingly.
    \endlist

    \image state-transition-navigator-buttons.png

    Now, you add the actions to the buttons. Actions determine what happens
    when you select a button in the application. In this tutorial, you use
    the buttons to switch between the different states.

    To add actions:

    \list 1
      \li Go to the \uicontrol Connections view.
      \li In \uicontrol{Navigator}, select \e button_side and in
      \uicontrol {Connections}, select \inlineimage icons/plus.png
      .
      This creates a new connection with \e button_side as the target.
      \li Set \uicontrol{Signal Handler} to \uicontrol onClicked.
      \li Set \uicontrol Actions to \e {Change state to side}.
      \li Repeat steps 2 to 4 for the next three buttons and set them to go to
      their corresponding states.
    \endlist

    \image state-transition-connections.png

    Now you can preview and try the transitions to see how the UI moves between
    the states when you select the buttons.

    To preview, select \key Alt + \key{P}.

    \section1 Animating State Transitions

    The final step of this tutorial is to create animations between the states:

    \list 1
      \li Go to \l{Transition Editor}.
      \li Select \inlineimage icons/plus.png
      .
      \li In the upper right corner of \uicontrol {Transition Editor}, change
      the number 2000 to 1000.
      This sets the length of the animation in milliseconds.
      \li Drag the left end of the timebar for \e car_final to the 0 mark in
      the timeline, and then drag the right end to the 1000 mark.
      \li Repeat the above step for \e {camera1}.
    \endlist

    \image state-transition-transitions.png

    This adds the transition and sets the animation durations to 1 second
    (1000 ms). By default, all properties that have changed between the states
    are added to the transition and therefor animated. In
    this case, the properties are Y rotation for the car model and Z position
    for the camera.

    \section1 Previewing

    Now you are done. To preview and try the transitions animations,
    select \key Alt + \key{P}.
